## Course Description
This one-day advanced Python course introduces graduate students and postdoctoral scientists to parallel and distributed computing using Dask, with a focus on large-scale biomedical data analysis. Participants will learn how to process and analyze 2D/3D image data and sequencing datasets using Dask Arrays and DataFrames, including out-of-core computation and storage with Zarr. The course covers local parallelism, distributed computing on SLURM clusters, and best practices for performance profiling and optimization. Through lectures, hands-on exercises, and real-world examples, attendees will gain the skills to scale their existing NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-image workflows to handle large datasets efficiently and reproducibly.

## Course Objectives
By the end of this course, participants will be able to:
- Understand the need for parallel and distributed computing in handling large biomedical datasets.
- Learn what Dask is and how it enables parallel processing by dividing work into tasks.
- Familiarize with Dask’s core concepts (task graphs, schedulers, lazy evaluation) and how it integrates with Python’s scientific stack.

## Dask DataFrames for Large Tabular Data  
### Session 3: ?:?? – ?:?? PM

## Refresher: What is a Pandas DataFrame?

- A **Pandas DataFrame** is a 2D, in-memory table of labeled, heterogeneous data.
- It's built on top of NumPy and designed for **fast, interactive data analysis**.
- Ideal for small to medium datasets that **fit entirely in RAM**.
- Provides rich functionality: filtering, joining, grouping, reshaping, time series support, etc.
<br><br>
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv") # e.g. sklearn breast_cancer dataset...

df.head()
```

## What is a Dask DataFrame?

- A **Dask DataFrame** is a parallel, out-of-core version of a Pandas DataFrame.
- Internally, it’s composed of many **smaller Pandas DataFrames** called *partitions*.
- It supports many familiar Pandas operations: `groupby`, `filter`, `join`, etc.
- Operations are **lazy**, building a task graph for optimized execution.
<br><br>
```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

df = dd.read_csv("data/large_dataset_*.csv")
```
<br><br>

## Why Not Use Pandas?

- **Single-threaded**: Pandas operates on one core — no automatic parallelism.
- **In-memory only**: Entire dataset must fit in RAM.
- **Eager execution**: Each line runs immediately, limiting optimization opportunities.
- **Limited scalability**: Great for small data, but struggles with "big-enough" data.

## How Dask DataFrames Work

- A **Dask DataFrame** is made of many smaller Pandas DataFrames called **partitions**.
- Operations are applied **independently** to each partition.
- Instead of executing immediately, Dask builds a **task graph** and delays execution until `.compute()` is called.
- This enables **parallel**, **out-of-core**, and **optimized execution**.

```python
# Nothing runs yet — this is lazy
result = df[df.score > 0.9].groupby("region")["value"].mean()

# Now the computation happens
result.compute()
```

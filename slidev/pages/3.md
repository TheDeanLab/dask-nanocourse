## Dask Cluster Types

### Local Clusters

**Single Machine Parallelism**
- Thread pool scheduler (default for arrays/dataframes)
- Process pool scheduler (for CPU-bound Python code)
- Distributed scheduler in local mode


**When to Use Local Clusters:**
- Development and prototyping
- Single-node HPC jobs
- Data that fits on one machine

```python

from dask.distributed import Client, LocalCluster

# Local cluster with custom configuration
cluster = LocalCluster(n_workers=4, threads_per_worker=2, memory_limit='2GB')
client = Client(cluster)
```

## Dask Cluster Types
### HPC Clusters
**Multi-Machine Parallelism**
- SLURM, PBS, LSF, SGE support
- Submit Dask workers as batch jobs
- Automatic scaling based on workload

```python
from dask_jobqueue import SLURMCluster
cluster = SLURMCluster(
    queue='normal',
    cores=24,
    memory='128GB',
    walltime='02:00:00',
    job_extra=['--constraint=haswell']
)

cluster.scale(jobs=10)  # Request 10 nodes
client = Client(cluster)
```

## Dask Cluster Types
### Cloud-Native Solutions

**Kubernetes Clusters**
- Container orchestration for Dask workers
- Auto-scaling based on demand
- Integration with cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)

```python
from dask_kubernetes import KubeCluster
cluster = KubeCluster.from_yaml('worker-spec.yaml')
cluster.scale(20)  # 20 worker pods
client = Client(cluster)
```

**Coiled:** Managed Dask clusters with auto-scaling and easy deployment.

**Saturn Cloud:** Provides Dask clusters with Jupyter integration and easy scaling.

**AWS Fargate:** Serverless Dask clusters on AWS, automatically scaling based on workload.

## Cluster Management Best Practices

**Resource Planning**
- Worker memory vs chunk size relationships 
- Network bandwidth considerations 
- Storage locality optimization

**Monitoring and Debugging** 
- Dask dashboard for real-time monitoring
- Performance profiling tools 
- Common bottlenecks and solutions

```python
# Monitor Cluster Performance
client.dashboard_link # web link to Dask dashboard
client.get_worker_logs() # retrieve logs from workers
```

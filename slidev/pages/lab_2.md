## Lab 2: Analyzing Large Tabular Data with Dask

- Use the first code block to generate some patient tumor growth data and save it locally as CSV. You can play with some of the parameters.

- Start up a Dask Client to visualize the Task Stream while working with Dask DataFrames.

- Explore simple Pandas operations with Dask DataFrames, including `map_partitions`.

- Try to combine what we've learned to recreate the average tumor growth, but now try to include **error bars**. Pandas Aggregation (`.agg()`) can be useful for this. You can use the dashboard to visualize the task stream.

Note: Can be performed on your local machine or on BioHPC.
